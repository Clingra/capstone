This is the data acquisition system progam I created for my capstone team. The goal is to receive inputs from load cells and dial indicators, and turn those inputs into a torsional rigidity value. This program effectively accomplishes this task by also graphing the input live, recording several torsional rigidity values and their parameters at the time of calculation, and exporting all recorded data at the end of the test for further analysis.
